    "Let's revisit the example from the [intro to agents](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/main/en/tutorials/../conceptual_guides/intro_agents): a bot that answers user queries for a surf trip company.\n",
    "Instead of letting the agent do 2 different calls for \"travel distance API\" and \"weather API\" each time they are asked about a new surf spot, you could just make one unified tool \"return_spot_information\", a function that calls both APIs at once and returns their concatenated outputs to the user.\n",

    "4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n",
